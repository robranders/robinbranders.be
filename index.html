                <p>
                    My old website was built in React. I had made a whole flow
                    where I could write blog entries in markdown and the app
                    would then convert that to a webpage. The only problem was
                    that I didn't write any blog posts ðŸ˜…. The idea of having a
                    blog is nice, but it requires time. I rather spend that time
                    learning something new or improving my skills.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I do like React and JavaScript but for my website I found it
                    a bit overkill. I wanted something simple and
                    "minimalistic", just HTML and some CSS.
